### Conceptual Description

I'm very passionate about the environment and sustainable development, and am in particular very concerned about the impacts we humans have had on the oceans. I feel very strongly about the fact that because of climate change, our oceans are getting warmer and more acidic (due to a greater amount carbon dioxide dissolving in our oceans), and as a result of oil spills, excessive plastic use, and our untenable waste production, our oceans are getting more polluted. Additionally, due to over-fishing, unsustainable beach and coastal development, and irresponsible marine recreation, there is an ongoing and tremendous amount of habitat and biodiversity loss in the oceans.

I decided to create an interactive and animated infographic that strongly drives home the severity of the damage we've done to our oceans and highlights the urgency of taking action to reduce the harm each and every single one of us commits due to our lifestyles and habits. My aim was to convey logical and factual information on the state of affairs of the oceans in an interesting manner, as well as more emotional appeals to pay attention to the issue, in an educational way. I hope the user will leave with a much greater awareness of the issue and a deeper sensitivity of our role and responsibility to be stewards of the oceans and protect the present and future of our oceans.


### Interaction Description

I envisioned my infographic as one that takes the user on a journey with different scenes that each highlight a different negative impact humans have had on our oceans. I wanted it to include different types of interactivity -- passive animations that the user had to sit through and grapple with (e.g. the first scene on ocean warming and acidification); videos that emphasized the reality of the problem (e.g the scenes on pollution and plastics in our oceans); data visualizations that were less aesthetic but more to-the-point and information-focused (e.g. the scene on over-fishing); scenes where the user had to explore and move their mouse around (e.g. the second-to-last scene). I intended my audience to be anyone and everyone ranging from children to adults, and thus strived to make the content and interactions accessible and engaging for all ages.

The animation in the first scene on ocean warming and acidification underscores how serious the impacts we've made have been since it clearly shows how drastically various measures like sea level, sea temperature, and coral cover have changed over time. In particular, I feel that the line graphs showing the sea level over each year is reminiscent of waves graphically, and the year-by-year increase effectively reflects a rapidly rising water line. The red color of the thermometer thread also signals alarm, and the grey shaded bar over the coral reef graphic as the amount of coral cover decreases symbolizes the tragic death of our coral reefs. In addition, I believe the shocking and heartbreaking videos on the polluted river and the manta ray swimming through plastics help hit home how devastating the situation currently is in actuality.

In addition, by letting the user get to know some of the species we humans have endangered by walking them through descriptions and photos of these species one-by-one, I had hoped that the feelings of loss would be amplified, thus spurring the user to feel more concerned about the issue of marine biodiversity loss. I chose to employ vibrant and hopeful colors in the second-to-last scene -- entitled "Maybe, just maybe, we could be, and should be more mindful of some things we do." -- to convey a sense that users did have agency and the power to make a change, if they wanted to. I made the scene explorable -- users had to mouse over the colored bars to reveal the calls to action underneath -- to suggest that that taking action was something that users should investigate and integrate into their lives.


### Extension

This piece was an extension of my data visualization project. I wanted to tell a story around that my initial data visualization scene and give more context as well as details beyond just ocean warming and acidification. I wanted to showcase actual videos and photos of how and whom we humans were harming in order to make the problem more poignant and pressing. I also wanted to include a call-to-action or an actionable message that users could take home with them and reflect on -- This was my rationale for adding the last two scenes, including the last scene which features a quote by a famous oceanographer directly imploring people to help conserve our oceans.


### Technical details

I used p5.js for the animated/dynamic elements of the page, including the p5.dom library -- which allows users to interact with HTML5 objects beyond the canvas, like video and text -- and well as the p5.scenemanager library -- which helped me create a sketch with multiple scenes. I chose to solely used p5.js because I wanted to challenge myself to approach the project solely from a graphic design and creative coding perspective. It would have been easier and simpler to use libraries like d3.js for charts and graphs, but I set my mind on seeing how far I could push the limits of what I wanted to express with only p5.js. I hosted my piece on Github Pages.

In my yoga class last semester, I learned about the concept of 'Ahimsa' -- the doctrine of non-violence and benevolence towards all living things, including oneself. As someone who struggles with anxiety and a harsh inner critic, this concept resonated deeply with me, and I discovered a tangential practice of loving kindness (mettƒÅ) meditation, which consists of consists of silent repetitions of phrases such as "may you be happy" or "may you be at peace", directed at a person/living being, whom depending on tradition, may or may not be internally visualized. In the version I practice, the target of one's well-wishes begins with oneself, but this goodwill extends outwards, first to one's loved ones, then to people about whom one feels neutral, to people with whom one has a difficult relationship, and finally to all living beings. I wanted to share my experience/practice with my family -- especially my mother, who shares a lot of similar struggles as I do. For my first project, I thus envisioned creating an external manifestation of what I visualized internally that would help evoke a sense of calmness and tranquility and encourage loving-kindness towards oneself and others.

My audience is anyone who needs or desires inner peace, especially people who have forgotten to be compassionate towards themselves. In order to inspire a sense of hopeful peace and tranquility, I chose a floral theme that represents life, new beginnings, love and beauty, and a soft and gentle yet vibrant color palette -- reminiscent of Spring -- to complement this theme. Along the same vein, I wanted to keep any flashy animations to a minimum, with a few simple, but effective interactive elements. One such element was the flowers appearing with the mouse movements, intended to be simulate the watering and blooming of a garden, and thus spark joy.

Other interactive elements were employed to fulfil my intention of creating a representation of my loving-kindness meditative practice. The concentric circles (which change the target of ones' goodwill when clicked) represent the concept of radiating benevolence outwards, and the clickable squares allow one to customize/switch up the phrase one repeats. I designed the mantra text to flash slowly and gently in time with one's repetitions of the phrases and one's breath. I hope to extend this piece of mine further by making it a more multi-sensory representation of my practice, perhaps by adding calming sounds of nature that usually accompany me when I meditate.
